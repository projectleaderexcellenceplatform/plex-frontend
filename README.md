<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, We're the PLeX heroes</h1>
## Plex Dashboard
The purpose of the PLeX (Project Leader eXcellence platform) dashboard is to increasingly support and unburden teachers in viewing projects and creating project lists. In addition, it is important that students can easily choose the top 3 of the projects offered in an overview, so that the project leader can see their preference.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
